A little bit introduction on types of equipment maintenance techniques that organizations commonly used across to reduce the downtime up to some extent with some limitations.

Corrective Maintenance: This is also called as a Run To Failure Maintenance. Which means, this maintenance will be performed only when the asset is failed.

Limitations: Since this maintenance comes under unplanned maintenance, it may lead to high risk for the Organization

Preventive Maintenance: This is a scheduled maintenance or time based maintenance which will periodically performs maintenance based on planned schedule in order to reduce the downtime of an equipment.

Limitations: This maintenance will lead to unnecessary maintenance which will increase the operational costs.

Condition Based Maintenance: This maintenance will be performed only when certain indicators show signs of decreasing performance or upcoming failures.

Limitations: Thresholds or indicators should be set against Equipment to identify whether maintenance should be performed or not.

All above Maintenance categories which will help to reduce the downtime of equipment up to some extent but not fully.

Predictive Maintenance (PdM): While unplanned and preventive Maintenance have the tradeoff scenario, predictive maintenance (PdM) is a promising technique that has an ability to break the tradeoff by maximizing the useful life of a component and uptime simultaneously.

Predictive Maintenance (PdM) is a maintenance that monitors the performance and condition of equipment during normal operation and reduce the likelihood of failures. Accordingly, the machine downtime and maintenance cost can be reduced significantly while making the maintenance frequency as low as possible.
